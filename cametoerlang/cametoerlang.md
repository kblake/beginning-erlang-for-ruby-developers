# How I was introduced to Erlang

* Heard about ["Programming Erlang"](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/programming-erlang)
* [Facebook used Erlang for chat](http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=14218138919)
* A year later I actually bought the book
* Walked through half of it and tried a couple erlang web frameworks

#Gogaruco

* [Blake Mizerany presented "Polyglot: When Ruby isn't enough or even sane (I'm going to hurt your nerd-feelings)"](http://gogaruco.com/schedule.html#mizerany)
* A lot of what he said I concurred with:
* Learn how others think, New paradigms (functional), No language is a perfect 10 across the board, Know bestand simplest tools for a job, Actively seek new knowledge
